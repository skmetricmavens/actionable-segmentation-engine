"""
Module: sensitivity_analyzer

Purpose: Perform sensitivity analysis on segments for robustness validation.

Key Functions:
- feature_sensitivity_test: Test segment stability with feature dropout
- time_window_sensitivity_test: Test consistency across time windows
- calculate_robustness_score: Compute composite robustness score

Architecture Notes:
- CPU-bound operations use multiprocessing
- Cache intermediate results
- MVP includes feature and time window tests only
